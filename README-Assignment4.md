Without EPT

## Question 3
I learned from the exit counts that the number of exits without EPT is a lot greater than the number of exits with EPT enabled. I expected the count to be higher without EPT since it is using shadow paging to run a virtual machine. 

## Question 4
What changed between the two runs was that the shadow paging VM was a lot slower to boot than the VM that used nested paging. The exits that greatly added to the boot time were exits 0, 1, 7, 14, 28, 52, and 58.
